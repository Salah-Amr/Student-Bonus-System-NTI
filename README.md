The **Student Bonus System** allows instructors or administrators to:
- View students' academic data
- Calculate total and average scores dynamically
- Add bonus degrees with validation
- Display detailed information for each student
- Receive instant feedback via notifications

The project demonstrates practical usage of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and browser APIs in a real-world scenario.

- **CSS3** – Modern UI, animations, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic, DOM manipulation, and validation  
- **Toastify.js** – User-friendly notifications  
- **BOM & DOM APIs**
